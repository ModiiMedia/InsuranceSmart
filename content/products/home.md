A home is one of your most valuable possessions. Whether you are a brand new homeowner or you've owned one or more homes for years, you need the right homeowners insurance to protect your investment.  A homeowners policy doesn't just protect your home, when properly structured, it can also protect personal belongings, yourself, and your guests.  We are here to help you understand plans available, and to structure the coverage you need at a price you can afford.

To get a preliminary quote complete the form above,  and after your quote is delivered, one of our qualified agents will contact you to refine this proposal for you.

## Discounts For Homeowners

You can get premium quality insurance without a premium quality price by applying available discounts.

Discounts are available if you have a burglar alarm or fire sprinkler system installed in your home.  You may also qualify for lower rates if you live close to a fire station. 

**Get a Package Deal**  
Save up to 15 percent when you combine your homeowners and auto policies.

**Multiple Policy Discount**  
Save even more with a multiple policy discount when you also add coverage for your [**motorcycle**](https://www.safeco.com/products/motorcycle-insurance), [**boat**](https://www.safeco.com/products/boat-insurance), or [**RV**](https://www.safeco.com/products/rv-insurance)

**Less Than 10 Years Old**  
Qualify for a newer home discount when your house is less than 10 years old.

**Choose a Higher Deductible**  
A higher deductible will lower how much you pay for your home insurance premium by shifting part of the loss payment to you. For example, if you have a $500 deductible, you’ll need to pay the first $500 of a loss out of your own pocket. A higher deductible will lower your home insurance bill, but will also increase how much you’ll end up paying yourself if you file a claim.

**Pay Your Bill in Full**  
If you pay your bill in full when you start or renew a policy, instead of paying in monthly installments, you’ll end up paying less in the long run. Talk to your [**local independent agent**](https://insurance-agent.safeco.com/find-an-insurance-agency/app) about additional ways to save that could help reduce how much you pay for homeowners insurance.

Contact a [**local independent agent**](/contact "Contact an agent.") to help you identify discounts and savings you may qualify for.
