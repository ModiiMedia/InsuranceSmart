## Discounts For Homeowners

**Get a Package Deal**

**Less Than 10 Years Old**  
We offer a newer home discount when your home is less than 10 years old.

**Choose a Higher Deductible**  
Choosing a higher deductible will lower your insurance premium because you are sharing more of the risk of a qualified loss payment to you. For example, a $500 deductible requires you to pay the first $500 of a loss out of your own pocket. Raising this deductible to $1000 or more will lower your homeowners insurance bill, but increases your out of pocket expense if you file a claim.

**Pay Your Bill in Full**  
Paying your bill in full when starting or renewing your policy, instead of in monthly installments also saves you money.

Contact one our our [**local independent agents**](/contact "Contact an agent.") with questions. We are here to help identify discounts and savings you may qualify for, and guarantee professional service to get you the coverage you need at a price you can afford.
