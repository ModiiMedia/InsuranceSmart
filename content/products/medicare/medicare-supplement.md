answer = "**Medicare Advantage** is a program that was designed to save money for the federal government.  When you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, **you actually disenroll from Traditional Medicare as your primary insurance provider**.  The Medicare Advantage plan you choose becomes your primary medical insurance and is responsible to meet all your medically necessary care.  Medicare Adantage plans typically have a specific provider network you must use for care and will not pay for services outside of network.  In addition, Medicare Advantage plans typically have a max out of pocket stop loss of somewhere around $7000 per year in the case of a major illness or medical emergency. \n\n**Traditional Medicare** is a program established by the Social Security Administration to pay for the medical care of seniors (those above the age of 65 and disabled) Traditional Medicare allows you to go to ANY DOCTOR, OR HOSPITAL that takes medicare and you choose your provider.
